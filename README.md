# GonXKillua-Pygame-Game


Hi folks, Hope you're doing well

I was inspired by the friendship between Gon and Killua in Hunter X Hunter Anime. 
They loved each other so much, and worked together to achieve their goals. This bond btn them was their power. 
I really cherish that type of friendship. I don't have close friends.

So, because this anime holds a piece in my heart, I woke up this morning with a motive to make a game.
It was so easy because I was just using pygame. 

Please be patient because I didn't finish the project because there're many things missing like a beautiful background that Gon and Killua deserve, as well as other many more customizations.
The project is open source, you can contribute.
